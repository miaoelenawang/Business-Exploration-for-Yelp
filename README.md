### Business Exploration and Interactive Visualization for Yelp

Yelp is a popular website that users can search certain business and get the users reviews and basic information
associated with that business. It is helpful and sourceful for making choices regarding eating, shopping for
individual life. Since Yelp just lists information for particular business, it is very hard for users to go
through lists of all business and have a high level view. In that way, it canâ€™t help people who want to grow
their business, improve their services. So we think of collecting all these information together from Yelp and
providing advanced analytics.

In our analysis, we choose restaurant as business entity. We want to help these business owners to get an
overview of how to choose site to start or expand a new business, how to set the right price and how to improve
their business though some attributes such as wifi and parking.
